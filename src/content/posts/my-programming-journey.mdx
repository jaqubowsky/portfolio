# My Journey in Programming

When I finished high school, I didn’t know what I wanted to do with my future. I wasn’t one of those people who had a clear path planned out. Instead, I felt lost. Like many others, I had a vague idea that I wanted to work in something related to technology, but I wasn’t sure what exactly that would look like. So, I decided to study informatics in college. I thought it was a safe choice—broad enough that I’d have time to figure things out later.

## My First Programming Class: From Confusion to Curiosity

In the beginning, it felt like I had all the time in the world. But then I took my first programming class, and honestly? It was overwhelming. The code on the screen looked like something out of a sci-fi movie, and I didn’t understand any of it. I remember feeling a mix of frustration and curiosity. Frustration because I didn’t know what I was doing, and curiosity because it was clear there was something powerful about programming. I wanted to figure it out, but I didn’t know where to start.

That curiosity is what kept me going. I started to learn little by little, outside of class. At first, it felt like I was moving at a snail’s pace. I’d spend hours just trying to understand basic concepts. But something interesting happened: the more I learned, the more I enjoyed it. Programming wasn’t just about writing code—it was about solving problems and creating things from scratch. It was like a puzzle, and every small breakthrough felt rewarding. That’s when I realized I was developing a real passion for it.

## Turning Passion Into Action

Once I figured out that I could potentially turn this passion into a career, I became even more motivated. I started putting in more time—sometimes dedicating entire weekends to learning. I worked on small projects, read tutorials, watched videos, and practiced as much as I could. It wasn’t always easy; there were times when I got stuck or felt frustrated. But I kept reminding myself that every expert was once a beginner, and if I stayed consistent, I’d get there.

## The Job Hunt: A Test of Patience and Persistence

However, I quickly learned that loving programming and getting a job in the field are two very different things. When I started applying for jobs, I faced a lot of rejection. It felt discouraging at times, especially after spending so much time preparing. I doubted myself more than once and wondered if I was good enough. But instead of giving up, I used those moments to push myself even harder. I built more projects, improved my skills, and kept applying.

After roughly a year of learning and applying, I finally got an offer. I can still remember the moment I found out I’d landed a job as a fullstack developer. It was one of the happiest days of my life, not just because I got the job but because it was proof that all my hard work had paid off. That moment gave me a sense of pride and confidence I hadn’t felt before.

## Where I Am Now: Still Learning, Always Growing

Now, I’m working full-time as a developer, and I couldn’t be happier. But my journey didn’t end when I got the job—in many ways, it was just the beginning. Every day at work brings new challenges, and I’ve learned so much since I started. I’m constantly exploring new tools, technologies, and techniques to improve my skills. Programming has taught me that learning never stops, and that’s one of the things I love most about it. There’s always something new to discover, and I’m always looking for the next challenge to tackle.

## Reflections on My Journey

Looking back, it’s amazing to see how far I’ve come. I went from being completely lost about my future to finding something I’m truly passionate about. It wasn’t an easy journey, but it was worth every moment of struggle. I’m grateful for every late night of coding, every failed project, and every rejection email because they all brought me to where I am today.

If there’s one thing I’ve learned from this experience, it’s that persistence pays off. No matter how daunting something feels at the start, if you’re willing to put in the time and effort, you can achieve amazing things. I’m proof of that.
